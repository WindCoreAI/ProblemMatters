      "description": "Retailers investing heavily in AI-driven personalization face a paradox: despite advanced data systems and recommendation engines, fragmented execution, mistimed engagement, and lack of financial accountability undermine impact. While 87% of retailers report AI has positively impacted revenue and 71% of consumers want GenAI integrated into shopping experiences, the reality is that retailers have spent heavily building 'single customer views' through cloud migrations and data platforms, but the technology alone doesn't solve the real challenge of disconnected operations. Mobile apps commonly ignore recent web activity, call center agents lack context from in-store conversations, and legacy workflows prevent unified experiences. A critical measurement problem compounds the issue: retailers judge AI personalization success solely on online conversion metrics, ignoring that over 73% of consumers use multiple channels before purchasing—a shopper might discover a product through AI recommendation but buy in-store, making that touchpoint appear to fail. Furthermore, treating personalization as purely a technology challenge fails without organizational buy-in; AI demands cultural shifts, not just software. Privacy, bias, and ethical concerns add complexity, with regulators scrutinizing AI applications under frameworks like the EU AI Act. The potential is significant: properly calibrated AI can enhance customer satisfaction by 15-20%, increase revenue by 5-8%, and reduce cost to serve by 20-30%, but most retailers are far from realizing these benefits.",
      "summary": "Despite heavy investment, AI personalization fails to deliver ROI for most retailers due to disconnected operations, measurement challenges focused only on online conversions, and organizational barriers to cultural change.",
