      "description": "Retailers face severe challenges modernizing their technology infrastructure due to entrenched legacy systems. Outdated systems drain up to 75% of IT budgets, leaving little room for innovation. Large companies spend an average of $17.7 billion on complete digital transformation according to Deloitte, yet 53% of professionals cite insufficient change enablement capabilities as a major barrier, and 57% report insufficient funding for digital investments. Retailers often operate fragmented infrastructures including outdated ERP systems, standalone CRMs, and inflexible POS systems that weren't designed for modern integration. Introducing next-generation technologies like AI, automation, and predictive analytics into this environment creates both technical and strategic complexity. 71% of retailers identify 'lack of real-time inventory visibility' as a significant obstacle—a direct consequence of systems that don't communicate. The fundamental issue is that legacy systems were built for transactions, not relationships; organizational and data silos are optimized for departmental metrics rather than customer outcomes. Beyond technology, the rapid pace of change has created a skills gap, with retailers struggling to hire or train staff proficient in new digital tools. Meanwhile, e-commerce now accounts for 23% of all U.S. retail sales and is growing at twice the rate of traditional retail, increasing pressure to modernize quickly.",
      "summary": "Legacy systems consume 75% of IT budgets while integration barriers prevent retailers from deploying modern AI and automation technologies, with 71% citing lack of real-time inventory visibility as a direct consequence.",
