      "description": "As AI code generation tools become mainstream in software development, organizations face a critical challenge: approximately 50% of AI-generated code contains potential security bugs and vulnerabilities. While AI tools like GitHub Copilot and similar assistants boost initial coding speed by 25-35%, these productivity gains are often erased by downstream bottlenecks. Developers spend significant time debugging AI-generated code that is 'almost right, but not quite'—the top frustration cited by 66% of developers. Trust in AI accuracy has dropped from 40% to just 29% year-over-year, yet 80% of developers continue using these tools. The nondeterministic nature of large language models means code quality is unpredictable, and security flaws learned from outdated repositories are propagated into new codebases. This creates a compounding technical debt problem as AI accelerates development tenfold while spreading insecure patterns quickly across organizations.",

The low-code market is projected to reach $50 billion by 2028, but the proliferation of these tools lets non-technical users build applications without traditional oversight. Citizen developers typically have no security training or awareness, leading to security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, and operational hazards when development capabilities extend beyond IT departments. Traditional security tools are ineffective for low-code applications due to their visual, drag-and-drop nature. Common issues include hardcoded credentials embedded in applications, organizations becoming dependent on third-party vendor security controls, and a lack of comprehensive inventory tracking of all low-code/no-code applications deployed across the enterprise.",
