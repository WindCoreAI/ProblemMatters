      "description": "Retail banks face significant challenges modernizing their core banking systems, many of which are 30-40 years old and built on outdated technologies like COBOL. The average banking application is 14 years old compared to just 4.5 years for retail applications. These legacy systems rely on batch processing, which restricts real-time data updates and instant customer responses. Limited API support makes connecting with modern channels, fintech partners, and third-party platforms extremely difficult. The shrinking pool of COBOL developers due to retirement means there is no new talent entering the workforce specialized in maintaining these systems. Core system replacement carries high risks, is expensive, often runs over budget, and takes years to complete. According to the American Bankers Association's 2024 Core Platform Survey, 35% of US banks are dissatisfied with their current core processes, yet only one in five are likely to switch providers due to the complexity and risk involved.",

This misalignment costs U.S. businesses $1.4 trillion annually due to CX failures, with $3.8 trillion in sales at risk globally in 2025. Many institutions claim to pursue omnichannel strategies but lack the operational alignment to deliver seamlessly. Customers feel like they're talking to different companies when moving from a bank's website to the app to a branch. When channels don't share data, the experience breaks quickly. While 52% of organizations prioritize enhancing digital experiences, only 25% are prioritizing modernization of legacy systems and back-office operations that make such experiences possible. Banks often make big investments in digital solutions but forget to wire improvements through to the back end, leading to improved satisfaction scores but limited ROI.",

In 2023 alone, digital payment fraud schemes totaled $485.6 billion in projected losses worldwide. Banks face AI-enhanced phishing campaigns, deepfake fraud targeting high-value transactions, and AI-driven social engineering. Supply chain attacks compromising third-party vendors have become a major vector. The financial sector faces the highest breach costs across industries, averaging $6 million per incident. Identity attacks driven by generative AI have exploded, with deepfake fraud attempts increasing significantly - for less than $1.00, someone can buy a deepfake to open a bank account. IoT devices create additional risks, including exposed ATM cameras enabling PIN capture. Due to evolving geopolitical events, the likelihood of cyberattacks on US financial institutions has increased, prompting regulators to encourage heightened awareness and business continuity reassessments.",

Banks face landmark regulatory shifts with new FATF guidelines emphasizing enhanced National Risk Assessments and beneficial ownership transparency. Traditional compliance methods are no longer sufficient with the rise of digital banking, cryptocurrencies, and DeFi. While over 70% of KYC onboarding is expected to be automated by 2025, the challenge of migrating paper-based CDD to digital ongoing due diligence remains a priority. AI adoption for AML faces concerns around bias, transparency, and explainability, with regulators demanding auditable models. OFAC has issued multiple eight-figure penalties in 2025, signaling regulators want risk-based programs with real-time escalation, not tick-box compliance. Identity attacks driven by generative AI have exploded, with deepfake fraud making it possible to open bank accounts for under $1.00. Balancing compliance rigor with customer experience is challenging, as thorough due diligence leads to longer onboarding times and customer frustration.",

Globally, 1.4 billion people lack access to a bank account, severely impacting economic development and social mobility. The primary barriers include fees and minimum balance requirements (cited by one-third of unbanked Americans), distrust of banks, privacy concerns, and lack of required documentation. Unbanked consumers are disproportionately lower income, racial or ethnic minorities, or in rural areas. Mississippi (11.1%) and Louisiana (8.1%) have the highest unbanked rates. Unbanked individuals are vulnerable to exploitation through predatory alternative financial services like payday loans and check cashing services. Without bank access, people cannot safely save money, earn interest, accept digital payments, or build credit history, limiting homeownership and economic mobility.",

      "description": "The lack of standardization among PSD2 APIs poses serious challenges for third-party providers, as integrating with totally different APIs for every bank is not practical and extremely resource-intensive. Multiple competing standards exist: Berlin Group's NextGenPSD2 (pan-European), OpenBankingUK (UK-based), and STET (French). Current standards describe broad frameworks with guidelines and best practices rather than strict procedures, leaving room for interpretation. Banks have had a mixed approach to PSD2, with the majority treating it as minimum compliance rather than customer-led innovation. The real challenge is connecting complex back-office environments before implementing open APIs, something fintechs avoid entirely. Strong Customer Authentication requirements disrupt payment flows and create operational risks. 48% of consumers are concerned about cybersecurity and data protection in open banking. Many banks find the incremental cost to enable, roll out, and maintain Open Banking unclear in terms of ROI.",

      "description": "Customer retention in the US banking industry dropped from 78% in 2022 to 76% in 2023, with approximately 15% of customers leaving their banks annually. Fintechs, online platforms, and credit unions are increasingly capturing market share. A 5% reduction in churn can boost profitability by up to 95%, yet acquiring a new customer remains 5-6 times more expensive than retention. A growing experience gap has paved the way for fintech challengers who are redefining customer expectations. Competition is no longer just other banks but every frictionless, personalized digital experience customers encounter. The advancement of technology has reduced information asymmetry, boosting competition and making retention management critical. Key churn indicators include declining login frequency, reduced transaction volume, withdrawals from checking and investment accounts, and unresolved complaints. Mobile channel interaction patterns help identify customers transacting with competitors.",

      "description": "Banks face significant challenges implementing real-time payments as most operate on decades-old technology built for daily settlement and batch processing, not 24/7 real-time execution. The speed, finality, and around-the-clock operation of instant payments create unique fraud prevention challenges since prevention must occur before initiation. While 92% of US banks offering instant payments consider interoperability between payment schemes, only 2% have implemented it. The dual-rail approach (RTP and FedNow) is adopted by 58% of institutions but adds cost and operational complexity. Running multiple real-time rails exacerbates liquidity fragmentation as banks lack real-time visibility into balances scattered across siloed systems. Staff augmentation or system revisions may be necessary to ensure AML reviews, OFAC screening, and customer due diligence remain compliant in real-time. The lack of ubiquity and interoperability is the leading challenge at 59% for non-FI participants, while 58% of FIs cite high upfront costs.",
      "summary": "Banks struggle to implement real-time payments due to legacy batch-processing systems, with only 2% achieving interoperability despite 92% considering it, while facing fraud, liquidity, and 24/7 operational challenges.",

Turnover rates have reached 25% annually. The US alone is projected to have a shortfall of 350,000 workers with digital and technology skills. A significant skills gap exists in data analytics, digital banking expertise, cybersecurity, and leadership succession planning. Banking professionals are leaving for fintech and tech companies due to inflexible work arrangements, outdated hierarchical structures, and more attractive equity-based compensation. 38% of employees are likely to leave within 12 months. Gen Z now accounts for over a quarter of the global workforce, bringing different expectations around work, purpose, and career development. 87% of organizations cite unrealistic salary expectations as a hiring barrier, while 47% struggle with unqualified applicants.",

Banks face margin declines of 5-10% across geographies as operating costs increase due to wage growth, financial crime costs, technology investments, and growing credit risk. Household debt reached a peak of $18.4 trillion as of Q2 2025, creating bifurcation where affluent customers continue spending while the middle class feels squeezed. Stablecoins could herald a new era of money, presenting challenges for banks as alternatives to deposits emerge. The economic baseline predicts GDP growth of only 1.4% in 2026, down from 1.8% in 2025, with recession concerns being the top worry for bankers. Subprime credit is also a looming threat. Retail banks plan to combat these pressures by focusing on new deposit acquisition and lowering funding costs, but competition from high-yield savings accounts and money market alternatives intensifies the challenge.",
