      "description": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the most critical global health threats of the 21st century, often described as a 'silent pandemic.' Drug-resistant bacteria and other pathogens are undermining the effectiveness of antibiotics and other antimicrobial medications that have been foundational to modern medicine. In 2021, AMR was linked to 4.7 million deaths worldwide, with over 1.1 million deaths directly caused by drug-resistant infections. Common infections are becoming harder—and sometimes impossible—to treat, with new WHO data showing that one in six bacterial infections globally are now resistant to standard antibiotics. The crisis is driven by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics in humans, animals, and agriculture, combined with poor infection control practices and limited access to quality medicines. Without urgent coordinated action, AMR is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050, rivaling cancer as a leading cause of mortality. The economic impact is equally severe, with projected losses of $3 trillion in global GDP per year by 2030. About 80% of antimicrobials used in animal husbandry are eliminated into the environment unmetabolized, contributing to resistance development in soil and water reservoirs.",
      "summary": "Antimicrobial resistance kills 5 million people annually and could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if unaddressed. Drug-resistant 'superbugs' threaten to make common infections untreatable and modern surgical procedures too risky to perform.",

Traditional passive surveillance systems suffer from incomplete and inconsistent case detection, delayed reporting, and poor integration with response mechanisms. Many countries, particularly low- and middle-income nations, lack the basic infrastructure for effective surveillance, with gaps in laboratory capacity, trained personnel, and data systems. The 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic and subsequent outbreaks have exposed persistent weaknesses in timely disease detection, contact tracing, and quarantine procedures. Progress toward meeting International Health Regulations has been uneven, with many countries unable to meet basic compliance requirements. While digital epidemiology tools offer promise, challenges remain with real-time adaptability, multilingual data handling, misinformation filtering, and policy alignment. A critical gap exists between epidemiological model predictions and healthcare resource allocation, with forecasts often failing to translate into effective coordinated responses. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that even wealthy nations struggled with surveillance integration and data sharing.",
