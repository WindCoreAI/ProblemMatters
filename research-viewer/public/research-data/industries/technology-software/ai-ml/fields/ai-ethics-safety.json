      "description": "AI systems trained on historical data often inherit and amplify existing societal biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in high-stakes decisions like hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare. A 2025 University of Melbourne study found AI hiring tools struggled to accurately evaluate candidates with speech disabilities or heavy non-native accents. With nearly 90% of companies now using some form of AI in hiring, these biases affect millions. The problem encompasses input bias (biased training data), system bias (algorithmic design choices), and application bias (deployment context). Despite great efforts, biases cannot be completely eliminated from AI systems - some we must learn to manage. The EU AI Act and state-level regulations in California and New York are driving compliance requirements, while Japan passed its first AI-specific Basic Act in May 2025 emphasizing fairness audits.",
      "summary": "AI systems perpetuate and amplify societal biases, causing discrimination in hiring, lending, and other critical decisions affecting millions, with complete elimination proving impossible.",
