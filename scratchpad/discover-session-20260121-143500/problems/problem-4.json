  "slug": "extreme-cryogenic-operating-requirements",
  "description": "Superconducting quantum computers face a fundamental operational challenge: they require cooling to temperatures near absolute zero, typically 10-20 millikelvin (-273.14C to -273.13C), which is colder than outer space. This extreme cooling is achieved through dilution refrigerators that use a mixture of helium-3 and helium-4 isotopes. The technology demands are immense: a single dilution refrigerator costs between $500,000 and $3 million, consumes 25-50 kW of power continuously (equivalent to 10 average homes), and requires specialized infrastructure and expertise to operate. The cooling requirements create a fundamental energy paradox where the power needed for refrigeration vastly exceeds the energy consumed by quantum computation itself. At the coldest stage (20 mK), cooling capacity drops to just 30 microwatts, severely limiting the number of qubits and control electronics that can be integrated. As quantum systems scale up, they encounter super-linear energy consumption where doubling qubits more than doubles energy needs. The scarcity of helium-3, a critical component in dilution refrigerators, adds supply chain vulnerability. Control electronics generate heat that threatens qubit coherence, requiring complex multi-stage cooling architectures. Current systems like IBM's 127-qubit Eagle require 10 kW just for control and readout systems. These requirements dramatically increase total cost of ownership, limit deployment to specialized facilities with dedicated cryogenic infrastructure, and create barriers to commercialization and widespread adoption of quantum computing technology.",
  "summary": "Superconducting qubits require cooling to near absolute zero (-273C) using dilution refrigerators that cost $500K-$3M each, consume 25-50kW continuously, and face fundamental physics limits that restrict scalability and deployment options.",
