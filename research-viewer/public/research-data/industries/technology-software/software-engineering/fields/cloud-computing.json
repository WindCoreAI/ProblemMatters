      "description": "Cloud and AI costs are no longer predictable or linear. Ephemeral environments, GPU workloads, managed services, and AI inference can change spend dramatically in days, not months. Organizations that treat cost as 'someone else's problem' are struggling as AI workloads create unexpected budget overruns—some organizations running AI at scale now pay tens of millions each month. IDC's 2025 research shows that 47% of IT leaders cite technical debt as a major contributor to overspending on cloud and digital infrastructure. Many teams experimented with DIY automation in 2024-2025 and now face 'integration tax': dozens of custom scripts, inconsistent standards, unclear ownership, and slow onboarding for new developers. Heading into 2026, the focus is shifting from experimentation to ensuring reliability and repeatability while controlling costs. The challenge is balancing speed of delivery with cost efficiency and preventing runaway infrastructure spending.",
