  "title": "Error Correction Resource Overhead",
  "slug": "error-correction-resource-overhead",
  "description": "Quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for practical quantum computing, but current approaches require enormous physical qubit overhead to create reliable logical qubits. The dominant surface code architecture demands approximately 100 to 1,000 physical qubits for each logical qubit, creating an insurmountable barrier to scaling quantum computers for real-world applications. This massive overhead stems from fundamental physical constraints: qubits are extraordinarily fragile, with coherence times measured in microseconds and gate error rates between 0.1% and 1%. Environmental noise, thermal fluctuations, and imperfect control operations continuously corrupt quantum states.\n\nA critical paradox compounds this challenge: error correction only provides net benefit when physical error rates fall below a specific threshold (approximately 1%). Above this threshold, the additional qubits and gates required for error correction introduce more errors than they remove, making the system worse rather than better. After three decades of research, Google's Willow processor only recently demonstrated operation below this threshold in late 2024, achieving a 0.143% error per cycle with a distance-7 code.\n\nThe consequences are severe. To run commercially useful quantum algorithms, millions of physical qubits would be needed—far beyond current capabilities of systems with hundreds of qubits. This delays the projected $877 billion economic impact of quantum computing between 2025-2035, affecting drug discovery (where quantum simulation could reduce $2.6 billion, decade-long development timelines), financial optimization, materials science, and cryptography. Recent advances in quantum LDPC codes and bosonic (cat) qubits show promise for 10x or greater overhead reduction, but these approaches remain experimental and face their own engineering challenges including connectivity requirements and control complexity.",
  "summary": "Current quantum error correction requires 100-1,000 physical qubits per logical qubit, creating massive resource overhead that prevents scaling to commercially useful quantum computers and delays projected hundreds of billions in economic value.",
