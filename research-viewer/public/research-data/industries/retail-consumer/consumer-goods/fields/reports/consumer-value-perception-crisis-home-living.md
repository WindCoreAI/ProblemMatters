# Consumer Value Perception Crisis in Home Living Products

## Executive Summary

The home living products sector faces a persistent and structural consumer value perception crisis that has not recovered since the 2022 inflation peak. Despite inflation moderating to approximately 2.7% by mid-2025, large segments of consumers continue to feel they are not receiving good value at fair prices. This "perception lag" has fundamentally altered consumer behavior, with 4 in 10 Americans now classified as "value seekers" who exhibit three or more cost-conscious, deal-driven behaviors each month.

The crisis is compounded by broader economic pressures affecting household budgets. Nearly 24% of US households now live paycheck to paycheck, spending over 95% of their income on necessities like housing, groceries, and utilities. For lower-income households, this figure rises to 29%, up from 27.1% in 2023. Housing costs alone increased 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, leaving minimal discretionary income for home furnishings and improvements.

The consequences for the $1+ trillion global home furnishings market are significant: spending on furniture and appliances has remained essentially flat while consumers redirect spending toward experiences like travel, dining, and entertainment. Brand loyalty has eroded dramatically, with value becoming twice as important as brand in purchase decisions. The retail sector faces a compounding trust deficit, earning consumer trust scores 12% lower than other B2C industries. Without coordinated responses addressing both value perception and underlying affordability challenges, this structural shift threatens the long-term health of the home living products industry.

## Background & Context

### Industry Overview

The global home furnishing market was valued at approximately $1,018.2 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $1,703.86 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 9.2%. The US market represents a significant portion of this total, with the National Retail Federation forecasting overall retail sales growth of 2.7% to 3.7% in 2025.

However, beneath these headline numbers lies a more challenging reality. The home furnishings category has experienced stagnant consumer spending even as other retail categories recover. Survey data indicates that consumers are prioritizing experiences over home purchases, with 47% of respondents citing domestic vacations as a spending priority, followed by concerts (25%) and sporting events (20%), while furniture purchases are actively being deferred.

### Genesis of the Crisis

The current value perception crisis traces directly to the inflation surge that peaked in 2022. During this period, household furnishings and home goods prices increased significantly as manufacturers and retailers faced supply chain disruptions, elevated raw material costs, and shipping challenges. Consumers experienced rapid price increases that outpaced both their expectations and their wage growth.

While headline inflation has since moderated, the price increases implemented during 2022-2023 largely remain in place. Consumers remember the lower prices of the pre-inflation era, creating a persistent perception gap. The December 2025 Consumer Price Index showed household furnishings and operations prices still increasing 4.0% year-over-year, maintaining pressure on household budgets.

### The New Consumer Reality

The post-inflation consumer landscape is characterized by several behavioral shifts:

1. **Value-seeking behavior**: 40% of Americans now actively exhibit cost-conscious, deal-driven purchasing patterns
2. **Paycheck-to-paycheck living**: 24% of all US households and 29% of lower-income households spend over 95% of income on necessities
3. **Brand disloyalty**: Value has become twice as important as brand loyalty in purchase decisions
4. **Deferred purchases**: Consumers are postponing big-ticket home purchases in favor of smaller indulgences and experiences
5. **Trade-down and trade-up paradoxes**: 75% of consumers report trading down in at least one category, while 39% simultaneously splurge in others

## Problem Analysis

### Root Causes

#### 1. Persistent Psychological Impact of 2022 Peak Inflation

The inflation spike of 2022 created lasting psychological scarring among consumers. Even as inflation has moderated to near the Federal Reserve's 2% target, consumer value perceptions have not recovered. This "perception hysteresis" manifests as heightened price sensitivity, increased deal-seeking behavior, and a fundamental recalibration of what constitutes "fair value." Research indicates that these mindset shifts often persist for years after the triggering economic events.

**Evidence**: 4 in 10 Americans now exhibit three or more cost-conscious, deal-driven behaviors monthly, classified as "value seekers" by Deloitte research.

#### 2. Wage Growth Lagging Inflation for Middle and Lower-Income Households

Since January 2025, inflation has outpaced after-tax wage growth for middle- and lower-income households. This erosion of real purchasing power directly impacts discretionary categories like home furnishings. While aggregate employment and wage data may appear healthy, the distribution of gains has been uneven, leaving significant population segments with diminished capacity for non-essential purchases.

**Evidence**: 29% of lower-income households living paycheck to paycheck in 2025, up from 27.1% in 2023, according to Bank of America Institute analysis.

#### 3. Housing Cost Escalation Consuming Discretionary Budgets

Housing costs represent the largest expense category for most households. The 14% increase in housing costs between September 2023 and September 2025 has crowded out discretionary spending on home improvements and furnishings. Ironically, higher housing costs create a greater need for home comfort and functionality, but simultaneously eliminate the budget to address these needs.

**Evidence**: Bureau of Labor Statistics data documenting 14% housing cost increase over two-year period, with continued pressure in 2025-2026.

#### 4. Tariff Threats and Supply Chain Cost Pressures

The home furnishings industry relies heavily on imports from key manufacturing countries. Proposed tariffs threaten to raise furniture costs by $8.5-13.1 billion according to National Retail Federation analysis. These potential cost increases come at the worst possible time, as consumers are already skeptical of value and retailers face margin pressure from promotional intensity.

**Evidence**: NRF report projecting substantial tariff impacts on furniture pricing; 40% of furniture retailers cite economic uncertainty as their biggest 2025 concern.

#### 5. Erosion of Retail Sector Trust

Consumer trust in the retail sector has declined due to false advertising, data privacy concerns, poor online ratings, and misleading sustainability claims. This trust deficit compounds the value perception challenge, as consumers are less likely to believe retailer claims about quality, durability, and value propositions.

**Evidence**: Deloitte research showing retail consumer trust score 12% lower than hospitality and food sectors; Edelman Trust Barometer documenting a "Crisis of Grievance" affecting brand trust.

### Consequences & Impact

#### Economic Impacts

**Market Stagnation**: Spending on furniture and appliances has "hardly changed" according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data, while other consumer categories show growth. This flat performance represents billions in foregone sales for the industry.

**Margin Compression**: Retailers face a squeeze between elevated input costs and the need for continuous promotional activity. The expectation of perpetual discounting has become embedded in consumer psychology, making full-price selling increasingly difficult.

**Market Polarization**: Premium brands are outperforming while middle-market retailers serving lower-income consumers see muted results. This bifurcation hollows out the market middle and concentrates gains among fewer players.

**Potential Tariff Impact**: $8.5-13.1 billion in additional costs may flow through the system if proposed tariffs are implemented, with uncertain ability to pass through to price-sensitive consumers.

#### Social Impacts

**Household Financial Stress**: Nearly a quarter of US households are already spending 95%+ of income on necessities. The inability to furnish and maintain homes adequately may contribute to broader quality-of-life challenges.

**Deferred Home Investment**: Consumers delaying furniture purchases may be living with worn, inadequate, or inappropriate furnishings, affecting daily comfort and functionality.

**Debt Accumulation**: The popularity of BNPL solutions (influencing 48% of consumer decisions) may mask underlying affordability challenges while contributing to household debt burdens.

#### Industry Structural Impacts

**Brand Erosion**: With value twice as important as brand in purchase decisions, decades of brand building are at risk. Private label expansion threatens branded manufacturers' market positions.

**Channel Shift**: Online and non-store sales growing 7-9% annually while physical retail struggles, requiring significant investment in omnichannel capabilities.

**Trust Deficit**: The 12% trust gap versus other B2C sectors creates a headwind for the entire industry, requiring systematic trust-rebuilding efforts.

## Current Solutions Landscape

### Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Financing

BNPL services have become ubiquitous in home furnishings retail, with 48% of consumers reporting that BNPL availability influences their purchase decisions. These services reduce sticker shock by spreading payments over time, enabling purchases that might otherwise be deferred.

**Limitations**: BNPL addresses the symptom (inability to pay full price upfront) rather than the cause (value perception gap). The 31% of consumers who would abandon their cart entirely without BNPL indicates dependency rather than genuine value satisfaction. Additionally, BNPL can contribute to consumer debt accumulation.

### Private Label and Store Brand Expansion

Retailers are developing trusted private label products that offer perceived better value at higher margins. This strategy simultaneously addresses consumer price sensitivity and retailer margin requirements.

**Limitations**: Private label development requires significant investment in product development, sourcing, and quality assurance. Not all categories translate well to private label, and brand perception challenges remain for complex, design-forward products.

### Dynamic Pricing and Promotional Strategies

Retailers employ sophisticated pricing tools, competitor monitoring, and strategic promotions to attract price-sensitive consumers. Holiday periods and promotional events have become essential drivers of purchase activity.

**Limitations**: Perpetual promotional activity creates consumer expectations for discounts, eroding willingness to pay full price. Race-to-bottom price competition can damage brand equity and create unsustainable economics.

### Omnichannel Experience Investment

Investments in seamless multi-channel shopping, personalized recommendations, AR/VR visualization tools, and efficient checkout processes aim to improve the overall customer experience and justify value propositions through service excellence.

**Limitations**: Significant technology investment required; benefits accrue primarily to tech-savvy consumers; doesn't directly address the underlying price/value perception disconnect.

## Solution Gaps & Opportunities

### Gap 1: Transparent Value Communication Frameworks

No industry-wide standards exist for communicating true product value beyond price. Consumers struggle to assess durability, cost-per-use over product lifetime, sustainability credentials, and quality metrics that would enable informed comparisons.

**Opportunity**: Development of standardized value metrics and labeling systems that help consumers understand long-term value. Similar to energy efficiency ratings for appliances, furniture and home goods could carry standardized durability, material quality, and sustainability ratings that justify price differences.

### Gap 2: Trust Rebuilding Initiatives at Scale

Despite the documented 12% trust deficit versus other B2C sectors, few coordinated industry efforts address the root causes of trust erosion. Individual company efforts to improve trust face collective action problems.

**Opportunity**: Industry-wide trust certification programs addressing pricing transparency, authentic sustainability claims, and data privacy practices. Establishment of chief trust officer roles within major retailers. Third-party verification of quality and value claims.

### Gap 3: Accessible Quality Products for Constrained Households

Current market offerings tend toward either low-quality disposable products or premium goods financed through debt. The 24% of households living paycheck-to-paycheck need access to durable, quality products at truly accessible price points without predatory financing.

**Opportunity**: Innovative business models including furniture subscription/rental services, rent-to-own arrangements with transparent terms, cooperative purchasing programs, and refurbished/circular economy offerings that provide quality without requiring large upfront expenditure.

### Gap 4: Policy Coordination on Tariff and Cost Impacts

The potential $8.5-13.1 billion tariff impact lacks a coordinated industry response. Individual companies cannot effectively advocate for policy changes, diversify sourcing, or develop transparent communication strategies in isolation.

**Opportunity**: Industry association leadership on trade policy advocacy; coordinated supply chain diversification; development of consumer communication frameworks that explain cost increases transparently while preserving trust.
