  "description": "The integration of quantum processing units (QPUs) into high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure presents one of the most significant technical and organizational challenges facing the quantum computing industry. Existing HPC resource managers such as Slurm, Load Sharing Facility (LSF), and Portable Batch System (PBS) were designed for classical computing workloads and are inadequate for managing hybrid quantum-classical workflows that require fundamentally different execution patterns.\n\nThe challenge manifests across multiple dimensions. At the hardware level, efficiently combining heterogeneous quantum systems (superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, photons) with classical computing resources (GPUs, CPUs) requires overcoming significant latency, communication, and orchestration barriers. Tight integration, where QPUs are accessed directly by HPC systems through common nodes, demands extreme hardware and software complexity that current solutions struggle to achieve.\n\nAt the software level, the absence of standardization spans from hardware communication protocols to software APIs and intermediate representations. Quantum programming typically uses Python or Julia for flexibility, while HPC applications employ C/C++ with OpenMP and MPI for performance, creating a fundamental gap. The fragmented quantum software stack requires integration across multiple layers from qubit control to application execution.\n\nDemonstrating clear ROI remains a major adoption barrier. While studies show organizations expect 10-20x returns on quantum investments, achieving these returns requires navigating talent shortages (only 12% of surveyed professionals have formal quantum training), infrastructure modifications, and organizational change management. The challenge is compounded by the strategic timing dilemma: moving too quickly risks overinvesting in immature technology, while moving too slowly could leave organizations unable to compete.",
