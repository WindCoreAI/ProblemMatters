      "description": "Over one-third of adults in the United States have limited personal health literacy, severely impacting their ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information needed to make appropriate health decisions. Adults with limited health literacy obtain less information from disease prevention and control materials, are less likely to undergo screening tests, and struggle to successfully manage chronic illnesses. Low health literacy is tightly linked to multiple social determinants of health, with educational attainment being the strongest predictor. Research demonstrates significant associations between low health literacy and poorer outcomes across numerous conditions: reduced mammography screening, poorer physician-patient communication, higher decision regret in cancer treatment, and associations with obesity and poor dietary choices. The field faces significant measurement challenges, with over 200 unique assessment tools created, none of which provides comprehensive, culturally-appropriate measurement across diverse populations. Many conventional literacy assessments contain cultural and linguistic assumptions from majority populations that may mischaracterize health literacy in marginalized communities. Health literacy is increasingly recognized as a modifiable risk factor that, if addressed at scale, could significantly reduce socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes.",
      "summary": "Over one-third of U.S. adults have limited health literacy, reducing their ability to understand prevention information, navigate healthcare, and manage chronic conditions. This modifiable risk factor contributes significantly to health disparities and preventable poor outcomes.",
