      "description": "Quality assurance teams face unprecedented challenges as AI accelerates development cycles from quarterly to weekly or even daily releases. The increasing use of AI means code is often AI-generated and deployed faster than QA teams can review it. A skills shortage compounds the problem—the shortage of skilled QA professionals is one of the most pressing challenges, with only 25 QA engineers per 100,000 citizens in regions like the UK while demand grows 25% yearly. 85% of QA managers report difficulty delivering innovation faster without compromising quality, as testing remains too time-consuming. Test automation maturity is lacking, with many teams still relying heavily on manual testing. The EU AI Act, effective August 2024, adds regulatory pressure requiring new standards for testing AI-driven systems, with penalties up to €35 million or 7% of global revenue. PwC estimates 70% of companies deploying AI applications in Europe will need to adapt their QA processes for compliance.",
