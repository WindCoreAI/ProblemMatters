      "description": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate plausible but factually incorrect information - a phenomenon called 'hallucination.' In a Stanford study, general-purpose LLMs hallucinated in 58-82% of legal queries, while even domain-specific tools like Lexis+ AI produced hallucinations in 17-34% of cases. According to Deloitte, 77% of businesses are concerned about AI hallucinations, with only 10% having moved GenAI solutions into production due to this barrier. More than 120 cases of AI-driven legal hallucinations have been identified since mid-2023, with at least 58 occurring in 2025 alone, leading to costly sanctions. Research by OpenAI in September 2025 showed that training objectives reward confident guessing over calibrated uncertainty. Crucially, research has formalized the problem and shown that complete elimination of hallucinations is mathematically impossible in LLMs.",
