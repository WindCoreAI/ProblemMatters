      "slug": "ml-model-production-deployment-gap",
      "description": "Despite significant investments in machine learning development, Gartner and other industry analysts report that approximately 85-87% of ML models never make it to production. This 'production gap' represents a massive waste of resources and unrealized business value. The challenges span technical issues (infrastructure complexity, API design, latency requirements), organizational barriers (siloed teams, lack of MLOps maturity), and operational hurdles (monitoring, scaling, integration with existing systems). Unlike traditional software, ML systems require continuous monitoring, retraining, and validation against evolving data patterns. Models that perform well in development environments often fail catastrophically when deployed at scale due to differences in data distribution, infrastructure constraints, and real-world edge cases.",
