      "description": "Despite years of investment in omnichannel capabilities, retailers are failing to deliver the seamless experiences customers expect. Only 17% of modern retailers rate their unified commerce capabilities as mature, according to Manhattan Associates research. Customer data sits in separate systems that don't communicate, creating blind spots and inconsistent experiences. 54.85% of shoppers have experienced discrepancies between online and in-store stock levels, undermining brand trust. The organizational challenge is equally severe: e-commerce has typically been treated as a separate channel with distinct staff, skill sets, data architectures, metrics, and budgets—even though customers view all touchpoints as one brand. The technology is not the sole problem; 'disconnected operations' mean mobile apps ignore recent web activity, call center agents lack in-store conversation context, and promotional experiences differ across channels. Legacy workflows, siloed departments, and misaligned goals prevent retailers from turning unified data into unified experiences. The business impact is stark: companies without strong omnichannel capabilities see only 3.4% year-over-year revenue growth compared to 9.5% for those with mature omnichannel engagement. 44% of consumers abandon carts due to delivery option uncertainty, highlighting fulfillment integration gaps.",
      "summary": "Only 17% of retailers have mature unified commerce capabilities, with data silos, organizational separation of channels, and technology gaps preventing seamless customer experiences and costing retailers significant revenue growth.",
