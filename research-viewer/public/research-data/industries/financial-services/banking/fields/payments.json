      "description": "Banks face significant challenges implementing real-time payments as most operate on decades-old technology built for daily settlement and batch processing, not 24/7 real-time execution. The speed, finality, and around-the-clock operation of instant payments create unique fraud prevention challenges since prevention must occur before initiation. While 92% of US banks offering instant payments consider interoperability between payment schemes, only 2% have implemented it. The dual-rail approach (RTP and FedNow) is adopted by 58% of institutions but adds cost and operational complexity. Running multiple real-time rails exacerbates liquidity fragmentation as banks lack real-time visibility into balances scattered across siloed systems. Staff augmentation or system revisions may be necessary to ensure AML reviews, OFAC screening, and customer due diligence remain compliant in real-time. The lack of ubiquity and interoperability is the leading challenge at 59% for non-FI participants, while 58% of FIs cite high upfront costs.",
      "summary": "Banks struggle to implement real-time payments due to legacy batch-processing systems, with only 2% achieving interoperability despite 92% considering it, while facing fraud, liquidity, and 24/7 operational challenges.",
