      "description": "Retailers face a critical pricing strategy crisis as years of inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs have left customers scrutinizing every dollar, making broad price increases untenable. In the UK, grocery inflation hit 4.4% in May 2025, pushing shoppers to prioritize value. Approximately two-thirds of retail promotions are ineffective, leading to reduced profits, wasted labor, and missed sales opportunities year after year. Retailers are caught between maintaining margin integrity and losing price-sensitive customers: 67% of consumers say they will shop more frequently with smaller basket sizes, and 56% value lower prices over brand loyalty. Between supply chain disruptions, persistent inflation, and rising advertising costs, retailer margins are razor-thin. Premium brands like Samsung and LG have leaned into deeper discounts, while legacy value brands like Whirlpool are pulling back on promotions to maintain margin. The challenge is finding the data-informed sweet spot between price image optimization, key value item (KVI) pricing, and margin preservation—all while navigating tariff uncertainties and intensifying competitive pressures. AI-driven pricing optimization can deliver 1-2% sales increases and 1-2% margin improvements, yet many retailers still rely on outdated, spreadsheet-based pricing processes.",
      "summary": "Two-thirds of retail promotions are ineffective while inflation-weary consumers demand value, forcing retailers to navigate between margin erosion and customer loss with inadequate pricing tools and processes.",
