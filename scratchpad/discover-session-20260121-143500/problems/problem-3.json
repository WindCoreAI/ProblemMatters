  "slug": "scalability-wiring-bottlenecks-quantum-computing",
  "description": "Current quantum computing systems face critical scalability limitations due to the physical wiring infrastructure required to control and read out qubits. Superconducting quantum processors typically require two coaxial cables per qubit to deliver and read out control signals, meaning a million-qubit processor would demand approximately two million individual wires. At current scales, a cryostat for a 150-qubit processor with coaxial wiring costs approximately $5 million, with as much as 80% of that cost allocated to wiring alone. Beyond roughly 100 qubits, systems encounter thermal and spatial limits as the mass of metallic connecting cables creates unacceptable heat loads on cryogenic cooling systems operating at millikelvin temperatures. The wiring bottleneck introduces multiple challenges: thermal load from temperature gradients between room temperature and cryogenic stages, power loss and heating from Joule effects, noise coupling from room temperature to cryogenic components, and crosstalk between adjacent signal lines. Each additional qubit increases noise and crosstalk, degrading overall system performance. Building to one million qubits with current approaches would demand massive facilities and investment potentially reaching tens of billions of dollars. This fundamental engineering challenge represents one of the primary barriers preventing quantum computing from achieving fault-tolerant operation at commercially useful scales, with major implications for achieving quantum advantage in drug discovery, cryptography, optimization, and other high-value applications.",
  "summary": "Quantum computers require thousands of coaxial cables to control qubits, but scaling beyond a few hundred qubits creates thermal overload, crosstalk, and prohibitive costs, blocking the path to fault-tolerant quantum computing.",
